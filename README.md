# Notes

- "Standard" Plateau (Optional: get the Woodcutter's Axe from the Old Man's Cabin). 
- After getting Paraglider, climb to the "top" ledge of the Temple of Time and BLSS northeast toward Seres Scablands (Ridgeland Tower area). 
- Near the Seres Scablands, turn the BLSS toward Tabantha Bridge Stable. 
    - If you got the Axe, continue to the grassy area on the west/far side of the Tabantha Great Bridge. 
    - If you did not get the Axe, stop at the stable and get the Soldier's Broadsword (near the two crates on the east side of the stable) or the Woodcutter's Axe (against the covered wagon), then BLSS or windbomb to the west/far side of the Tabantha Great Bridge. 
- Use the Axe (or Broadsword) to cut grass until you get Tabantha Wheat. 
- Drop down to the ledge below the west end of the Tabantha Great Bridge. (Optional: Save in case you don't get Rock Salt) Bomb the ore deposits to get Rock Salt. 
- Drop down to the Tanagar Canyon Course (start of the Boom Bam Golf mini-game). 
- Cook the Tabantha Wheat and Rock Salt in the Cooking Pot to make Bread.
